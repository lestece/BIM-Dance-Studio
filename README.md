## 1. INTRODUCTION

This site has been created as a business website for a fictional Dance Studio, called BIM (Bodies in Motion) based in Edinburgh. The studio offers adults dance classes, from beginner to advanced levels, in Ballet, Jazz, Contemporary and Afro dance.

I've created this website to showcase my knowledge of HTML and CSS, responsive design and UX and UI Design. 
I wanted to create a design that is clean, modern and elegant to reassure users about the dance studio professionality and reliability. 

## 2. UX

### USER PERSONA & THEIR GOALS/NEEDS

Users are adults based in Edinburgh who want to:

- learn how to dance/improve their dancing skills
- be taught by qualified and trustworthy professionals
- be able to see a class timetable to decide if it would work around their schedule
- have clear pricing information
- have the chance to contact and locate easily the dance studio
- easily book a class with just a couple of clicks using their devices

### BUSINESS GOALS

- increase the amount of class participants and consequently the business revenue
- promote the dance studio online presence

### WIREFRAMES

All wireframes were created with [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).

### DESIGN
[See mockups](docs/mockups)
- #### COLORS

I've used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website to generate a colour palette for the website. The palette was generated from the __hero image__ from the homepage and then adjusted to my personal preferences. The result is a palette that fits well with the whole design and images chosen.
