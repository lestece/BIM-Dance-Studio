The second time the homepage was run through the validator, it returned a warning: this was easily fixed by switching the paragraph in the "meet the team" section with an h2 and giving this last one an ID to target it in the styles.css and contrast the bold font-weight style that was coming from the other h2's style.

- instructors.html validator warning:

The instructors page gave back a warning regarding the buttons section: easily and quickly fixed by replacing the section with a division block instead.
